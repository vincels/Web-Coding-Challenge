## Description
* Build a single page app with a sign-up form.
* The form should allow users to enter first name, last name, email, and password.
* All fields are required.
* Password validation:
1. Should be a minimum of eight characters,
2. Should contain lower and uppercase letters,
3. Should not contain user’s first or last name.
* Email should be validated but there are various ways of accomplishing this. So, show us what you consider as a proper email validation.
* The form should send a POST request to https://demo-api.now.sh/users. The request body example:
```json
{
  firstName: "Thomas",
  lastName: "Shelby",
  email: "thomas@shelby.co.uk"
}
```

## How to do it
* Use the latest version of Angular in combination with TypeScript.
* UX/UI can be based on a CSS Framework (or do it yourself with minimal effort).
* You can target browsers that support ES6. Do not worry about supporting old browser versions.
* Make your solution available on GitHub or GitLab or Bitbucket.

## How we review
Your application will be reviewed by two of our engineers. We take your experience level into consideration. The aspects of your code we will assess include:
* Correctness – Is it production-ready application? Does the application do what was asked? If not, does the README explain why it is missing and/or different?
* Code quality – Are there any code smells? Is the coding style consistent with the Angular style guide?
* Testing – Is your logic covered with unit or integration tests?
* UX – Is the web interface understandable and pleasing to use?
* Documentation – Is there a README covering how to build and run your project?
* Technical choices – Are choices of libraries, architecture etc. appropriate for the task?
